Twitter Pings
=============

Data project by Joel Willers
----------------------------

**Overview**
Display locations of tweets based on search parameters on a map of the world

**Project Description**
Allow a user to enter different search terms, each displayed as a different color,
and every time a Tweet uses the search term, the location is displayed on a map of 
the world as a dot of that color. User can enter several search terms and control 
the fade rate of the dot. 

**Possible uses**
This tool will be interesting to use, as a person could find out where certain topics
are being discussed. This will also be a good jumping off point for other location-based 
displays besides just showing Twitter search terms. Other data could be plugged into 
the data stream, such as new user accounts for certain sites, when people log into a 
site, etc. 

**Data collection**
Data will be collected using the Twitter API. Most Tweets do not seem to have coordinates, 
so reported location can be run through a converter to get latitude and longitude 
coordinates. If no locative information is given, the dot will not be displayed (or, 
alternatively, it could be shown in a separate area marked "?"). Once the coordinates are 
collected, they will be displayed on a map of the world using Shiny.
